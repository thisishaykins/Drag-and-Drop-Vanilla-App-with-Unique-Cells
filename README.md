# HTML/JS Drag-and-Drop Vanilla App with Unique Cells

This project demonstrates a simple HTML table with drag-and-drop functionality. Each cell in the table contains a rectangle box (`<div>` element) with a unique number and color. Users can drag and drop these boxes to swap their positions within the table.

## Features

- A table with 3 rows and 3 columns, each containing a draggable box.
- Each box is uniquely numbered (100, 200, 300, ... 900).
- The color of each box is distinct.
- Drag-and-drop functionality allows swapping boxes between cells.
- Bonus features include:
  - Fading color effect while dragging.
  - Smooth animation when swapping boxes.
  - Dynamically adding rows with unique-colored cells using the "Add Row" button.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository or download the source code.
2. Open `index.html` in a web browser to view the drag-and-drop table.
3. You can drag a box from one cell to another, and the swapped box will move with a smooth animation.
4. Use the "Add Row" button to add another row of unique-colored cells to the table.
